                        <p>Hi! Thank you for your interest in my profile. My name is <span id="yellow">João</span> and I'd like to invite you on a little walk together so that you can learn a bit more about me! Is that ok?</p>
                        <p>Use the arrow keys to navigate through the maze and I'll show you some stuff along the way.</p>
                        <p>If you get stuck or just don't like games press the button above and a path will come up. ;)</p>
                        <p>On our way then...</p>
